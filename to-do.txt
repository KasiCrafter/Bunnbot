[] Figure out how much delay is needed between sending picarto messages
[] Find a way to output messages even when users send commands at the same time (race condition issue, maybe?)
[] Successfully impliment instanciation (allow to join multiple channels at once, all with different clients)
   [] Implement manual calling/instanciation of bot on its own channel
   [] Remember users who have subscribed to the bot
   [] Create Admin Bot, which will be a self-bot that ONLY has commands/plugins that require Premium or Streamer access.
[] Prevent race condition by not writing if temp and main score files have different lengths of characters
   [] Properly untouched files will have the same length as the temporary file
