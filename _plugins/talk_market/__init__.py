>Stock Market<
-After a regular interval, announce "stocks" value and payout.
-These stocks are, behind the scenes, keeping track of chat activity, making certain "resouces" go up and down.
-Custom made "companies" (HLY, INL, CWL, HAL, and such) can be invested by the players with FUNBOX, which they get a %share of
-Companies have weighted ratios for the differnt "resources", with their "stock value" based of the sum of their ratios.
>Ex: INL (International Liabilities)  with rations (10%,33%, 10%, 10%) and resources of the corresponding resources (44,67,22,155)
     would be: (44*0.1)+(67*0.33)+(22*0.1)+(155*0.1), the total stock value coming to 44 FUNBUX per share.
-Unlike real life, there are no limit to how many shares you can buy from a company. Just don't go bankrupt going all in.

Objective: Make engaging stream game that gets chat moving and a talking point.
I'd like to:
-Have users check back on chat constantly
-Not be afraid to input/talk
-Create oportunities to form social bonds
-Not go on autopilot while playing

It'd be counterproductive if:
-It interrupted the flow of chat
-Overpowered the streamer in terms of appeal
-Used gimmiky random chance for everything



1.) Clear Goal/Goals - let the players know what to do from the outset

2.) Rules - make it at least somewhat challenging to meet the goal

3.) Interaction - players play each other, not the game alone

4.) Catch Up Feature - let losing players still ave a chance to win

5.) Inertia - the longer the game goes, the more the neutral state should push towards completion

6.) Surprise - the game must have some element of unknown information/possibility

7.) Strategy - make sure players THINK while playing; getting better at it, too

8.) Fun - reason why folks would enjoy playing this game; IMMEDIATELY wanting to play again

9.) Flavor - a metastory that makes it intuitive to see how the game comes together/works

10.) Hook - what would make OTHER people excited to play the game before even playing it
